# What is Docker?

Docker is a tool for creating/running containers, which are essentially lightweight virtual machines. The main benefit of Docker is that it makes applications much more portableâ€”instead of having to make sure the target machine has exactly the correct dependencies for deployment/local development, you can trust that any machine with Docker installed will be able to run your app.

# Installation

Docker can be installed using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. 

# Project Structure

The files required to setup Docker (as implemented in this class), are as follows:
- `Dockerfile` - This is a standard file required by Docker. This file describes how to take a fresh Linux installation and install all of the dependencies required to run your app.
- `dev_environment` - This is a helper script written/maintained by CS156 staff that abstracts away the Docker setup commands from the user. This script builds a "container", or virtualized Linux environment, from the `Dockerfile` and runs a bash shell inside of it.
- `.devcontainer.json` - This is an alternative to the `dev_environment` script for VSCode users. This allows VSCode users to use Docker through the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).
