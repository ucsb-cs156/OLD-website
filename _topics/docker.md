# What is Docker?

Docker is a tool for creating/running containers, which are essentially lightweight virtual machines. The main benefit of Docker is that it makes applications much more portableâ€”instead of having to make sure the target machine has exactly the correct dependencies for deployment/local development, you can trust that any machine with Docker installed will be able to run your app.

# Installation

Docker can be installed using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. 

# Project Structure

The files required to setup Docker (as implemented in this class), are as follows:
- `Dockerfile` - This is a standard file required by Docker. This file describes how to take a fresh Linux installation and install all of the dependencies required to run your app.
- `dev_environment` - This is a helper script written/maintained by CS156 staff that abstracts away the Docker setup commands from the user. This script builds a "container", or virtualized Linux environment, from the `Dockerfile` and runs a bash shell inside of it.
- `.devcontainer.json` - This is an alternative to the `dev_environment` script for VSCode users. This allows VSCode users to use Docker through the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).

# Starting the Container 
In order to start the docker container and enter the virtualized linux environment, simply execute the `dev_environment` script by running `./dev_environment`

# Known Issues

## I opened up `./dev_environment` in multiple windows and both windows are showing the same output
Sometimes, when you `./dev_environment` multiple times quickly, there is a race condition which causes the command to open up the same bash instance. To avoid this, make sure the first `./dev_environment` has loaded before running `./dev_environment` a second time.

# Instructions for WSL

To use the docker support in our projects on the Windows Subsystem for Linux environment (instead of native powershell/cmd/etc) you need to do the following:

* Make sure you have WSL2- this is a separate environment from regular WSL.
  - If you already have regular WSL, you can have separate Linux distributions with different WSL versions.
  - WSL2 setup is here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>
* Follow the instructions here for WSL2 Docker setup: <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/>
* Make sure you have `/mnt/c/"Program Files"/Docker/Docker/resources/bin` in your `PATH` variable in their WSL2 `.bashrc`
