# Tips for Performing Code Reviews

Always try to be helpful, not harsh.

- Realize that having your code reviewed by others, especially if you are new to that process, can be intimidating.  People can feel very vulnerable.
- It can help to ask questions rather than making statements.  

  Instead of "This code is a mess; do you even know how to indent?" try "I wonder if this code would be easier to read if the indentation were more consistent."

  Instead of "This isn't how you are supposed to write JavaScript" try "I wonder if you are familiar with the reasons that `const` and `let` are preferred to  `var`?"

# Tips for Responding to Code Reviews

Try to **respond from a position of gratitude**.  

- The reviewer spent time looking at your code.  Try to be grateful for their time.
- Show your appreciation by addressing each comment.  "Addressing" doesn't mean you have to do what the reviewer says, or that you have to agree with them.  It does mean that you should at least acknowledge their input.
- If you agree, make the change and say "Thanks, fixed" or at a minimum "Done".   Better is "good call, fixed", or "thanks for catching that, fixed".  If you learned something new, acknowledge that "Wow I didn't realize, thanks for pointing that out. Fixed."
- **If you disagree, don't just dismiss the comment**.  
- At the very least say: "Hmm, I see it differently; let's discuss".  Or "I'm not sure I understand your perspective; can you explain further?" Or "I see where you are coming from, but i/we think it should be like this..."
