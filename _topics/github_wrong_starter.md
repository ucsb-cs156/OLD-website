# Help! I pulled from the wrong starter

Here is an example of what it might look like if you pulled from the wrong starter repo, and *how to fix it*.

# First, the part that's correct

Here, we clone a `jpa01-fakeStudent` repo, and we see that the `origin` remote is correct:

```
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro ucsb-cs156-s22 % git clone git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git
Cloning into 'jpa01-fakeStudent'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro ucsb-cs156-s22 % cd jpa01-fakeStudent 
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (push)
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % 
```

# Now, we set up the wrong starter

We intended to set up STARTER-jpa01 as our starter, but instead we set up STARTER-jpa00:

```
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git remote add starter git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa00.git    
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (push)
starter	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa00.git (fetch)
starter	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa00.git (push)
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % 
```

Ouch!   `starter` refers to `git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa00.git ` when we intended `git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa01.git`

We can see that when we type `git remote -v`

# Doubling down

Now suppose we double down on the error and populate the repo with the wrong code

```
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git checkout -b main
Switched to a new branch 'main'
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git pull starter main

pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % ls
LICENSE		README.md	pom.xml		src
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % 
```

Now, the wrong code is in our repo.  What to do!?!?  Should we just delete the repo and start over?!!

We could.  But there's a better way.

# Fixing it

The first step in fixing it is to remove the old remote:

```
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (push)
starter	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa00.git (fetch)
starter	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa00.git (push)
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git remote remove starter
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (push)
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % 
```

Now redfine it as the correct one:

```
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git remote add starter git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa01.git 
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/jpa01-fakeStudent.git (push)
starter	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa01.git (fetch)
starter	git@github.com:ucsb-cs156-s22/STARTER-jpa01.git (push)
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % 
```

Hooray! The `starter` remote now points to the right place!

# But I still have the wrong code?!?

First, we need to be on the `main` branch:

```
git checkout main
```

Now we use three tools:

* `git fetch starter` will update our local cache of where all of the branches in the `starter` remote point to.
* `git reset --hard remote/branch` will allow us to reset our current branch to any `remote/branch`.  
   * Think of it like a "pointer assignment".  
   * The `--hard` part means that we are *also* going to update the file system to match
* `git push origin main -f` will allow us to push the new, redfined `main` branch to GitHub,  overwriting the old values.

Here's what that looks like:

```
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git fetch starter
remote: Enumerating objects: 109, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (109/109), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (39/39), done.
remote: Total 109 (delta 33), reused 109 (delta 33), pack-reused 0

pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % git reset --hard starter/main

 + 4167080...d5dec6b main -> main (forced update)
pconrad@Phillips-MacBook-Pro jpa01-fakeStudent % 
```

And that is how we do that.   You now have the correct code, from the correct starter, as if you had done everything right in the first place,
and no-one is the wiser.
