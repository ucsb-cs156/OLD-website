The CLI (Command Line Interface) for Heroku allows you to do several things with a running Heroku application
in a convenient way at the Linux, Mac or Windows command line:

* Checking logs 
* Interacting with the Postgres SQL prompt 
* Setting configuration variables

To install it, see the [installation instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) on the Heroku website.
