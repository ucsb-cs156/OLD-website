There is another page that talks about the _content_ of a code review here:
* <>

This page talks about the _process_ of doing a code review in GitHub, meaning the series of mouseclicks in the GitHub web interface that you need to 
do so that the code review "counts".

# Doing it properly

Do it like this:
* Go to the `Files Changed` menu
* Scroll through and look at the changes
* If they all look good, click the <img width="184" alt="Review Changes" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/170560166-0161b8a5-c0ff-4941-a1b6-798d64d36dc1.png"> button
* Enter `LGTM` and _click on Approve Changes_, i.e. <img width="451" alt="Approve Changes" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/170560341-51be368c-12a7-4365-8e54-570e54348d35.png">
* Then click <img width="154" alt="Submit Review" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/170560387-a33029a1-2358-4626-be23-41203f88b182.png"> (Submit Review).

The animation below shows the process.

# A _comment_ that says `LGTM` is _not_ a code review.

Not a code review:

I mean, it _is_, but not from the standpoint of GitHub.  If there are _branch protection_ rules in place that require a code review before 
the PR can be merged, a _comment_ does not trigger the PR to be mergeable.

Only a properly done code review does.

Here's an animation emphasizing the wrong way:
