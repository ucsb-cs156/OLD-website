The basic framework for web applications in CMPSC 156 from F20 forward is a particular way of combining:
* A Spring Boot backend
* A React frontend

The Spring Boot Backend provides:
* a RESTful API
* database operations on SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases

The React Front end provides
* the user interface

The two work together to provide
* OAuth login using Auth0
