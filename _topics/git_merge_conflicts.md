Sometimes you are going to merge a pull request, and you see this:

This indicates a merge conflict that must be resolved before you can merge the PR.

In this case, it is a merge conflict in the file `package-lock.json`, which, as we'll see, is a bit of a special case. 

It is so much a special case, that we are going to devote a whole separate page to it, here:
