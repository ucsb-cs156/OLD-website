Once we have our VPN running we can mount our csil drive to our local machine.


## Mount Drive Using Samba

To mount your csil drive simply open this link **[smb://samba.engr.ucsb.edu](smb://samba.engr.ucsb.edu)** in your finder. 
Or follow the ucsb [Engineering documentation](https://doc.engr.ucsb.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3342386) to do it manually. 

You will be prompted to login with your engineering/csil account. 
After loggin in with your credentials, you will be prompted to select the volume you want to mount. Scroll to the bottom and select your csil drive.

Once you are connected, you should have your csil drive mounted as a virtual disk right below Remote Disk in your finder. 

You can now access your shared files with read and write privilages!

**This can be `extremely` useful if you want to edit files on CSIL using your favorite `IDE`.**
