For some projects in this course, we've used Auth0, a commerical service that has a "free tier", to help manage authentication.

You can create an account on the free tier at <https://auth0.com>.   
* For simplicity of course management, we suggest you create this account using your `userid@ucsb.edu` email address.
* The first step is to create a _tenant_, as explained below.

# What is a _tenant_ 

A tenant is simply a related group of applications.  Think of a tenant as way to segment your Auth0 account
into multiple subaccounts for different purposes. For example, you might have:
* One tenant for all of your individual work in this course
* A separate tenant that your entire team shares, for your group work in this course.
* Another tenant for personal projects
* Yet another for a personal group project you undertake for a "hackathon"

Tenants can be private to just one user, or shared among multiple users.

We suggest that you name your initial tenant `ucsb-cs156-cgaucho` where `cgaucho` is the `userid` part of your `userid@ucsb.edu`.
