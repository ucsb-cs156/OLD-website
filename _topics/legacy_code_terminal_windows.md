While this may seem extreme, Prof. Conrad suggests having six terminal windows, each with specific roles to play.

| Num | Name | Directory | Purpose |
|-----|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Main | root of repo | Running git commands, and running `code .` to open VS Code |
| 2 | Backend | root of repo | Run backend with `mvn spring-boot:run` |
| 3 | Backend tests | root of repo | Run backend tests with `mvn test` <br /> or Test coverage with `mvn test jacoco:report` |
| 4 | Frontend | `javascript` | Run frontend with `npm start` |
| 5 | Frontend Tests | `javascript` | Run front end unit tests `npm test`<br /> jest coverage with `npm run coverage`, <br />Stryker coverage with `npx stryker run`, <br /> or eslint with `npx eslint --fix src` |
| 6 | Storybook | `javascript` | Run storybook with `npm run storybook` |

While there is nothing sacred about this *particular* way of organizing things, having *some* specific convention will help
you keep your work organized, and is especially helpful when communicating with others on your team or with staff about
what you are working on.


# MacOS Script

The following script can be used on MacOS to open up these 6 windows.

    tell application "System Events" to keystroke "t" using {command down}

     set the background color of window 1 to {r, g, b}
    end tell
    delay 0.1
end makeTab
