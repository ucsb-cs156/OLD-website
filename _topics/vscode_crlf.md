There are different conventions on different systems for line endings.

* There is a character called CR (Carriage Return), which is ASCII/Unicode xx 
* There is a character called LF (Line Feed), which is ASCII/Unicode xx

Some systems just put a CR character at the end of every line.

Others put a CR followed by an LF at the end of every line.

This can creates havoc.

Fortunately, in VSCode, there's a handy way to tell which line endings a file is using.

Look at the bottom right hand corner, and you'll see something like this:




# Why is it is like this?

This is a throwback to the very early days of computing.

Back in the day, when computers were hooked up to teletypwriters, the carriage return literally
moved the print head back to the start of a line.

The line feed moved the paper up by one line.
