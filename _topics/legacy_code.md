If you become a professional software developer, whether in industry, government, academia, or in an open source community, most of your contributions will be to _legacy code_.

The definition of _legacy code_ that we use in this course is this:

* Code that has a life before, during and after your contributions

In school, you start from nothing, and write *all* of the code yourself, or perhaps there is some relatively minimal starter code provided to you by an instructor.

Starting from a clean slate, this is sometimes called "greenfield" development.

However, most work done as a software developer is to take a _preexisting_ piece of software and either fix bugs, add features, or refactor.

Working with a legacy code base differs in some significant ways from doing greenfield work; this is one of the major themes of the course.

For more on the ways it differs, see the paper [Listening to Early Career Software Developers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3199572.3199591),
