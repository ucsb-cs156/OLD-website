# Note about the textbooks for the course:

Both Head First Java 2nd Edition, and Java in a Nutshell 7th edition, are available in "full text", at no charge, to UCSB students (see below).

There is a "catch": In past years, there were a limited number of "seats" for access to the UC subscription to the O'Reilly library that provides this access.   If you login at a time when "too many" folks from across the UC System (yes, all nine campuses), you might get an error.    This hasn't happened in a while, so maybe it's no longer a problem, but be warned.
